        {`Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of this website,
        including any related calls texts or other communications, will be
        resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you
        may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. This
        includes claims against our clients, vendors, and Marketing Partners,
        which are third party beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement. The
        Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this
        agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of
        an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an
        individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including
        injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow
        the terms of these terms as a court would. The arbitration may be
        conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules,
        including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related
        Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling
        1-800-778-7879. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by
        telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county
        where you live or at another mutually agreed location. We each agree
        that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an
        individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative
        action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in
        arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree
        that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other
        misuse of intellectual property rights. MODIFICATIONS. Company may, in
        its sole discretion and without prior notice, (a) revise these Terms of
        Use; (b) modify the Site and/or the Service; and (c) discontinue the
        Site and/or Service at any time. Company shall post any revision to
        these Terms of Use to the Site, and the revision shall be effective
        immediately on such posting. You agree to review these Terms of Use and
        other online policies posted on the Site periodically to be aware of any
        revisions. You agree that, by continuing to use or access the Site
        following notice of any revision, you shall abide by any such revision.`}
